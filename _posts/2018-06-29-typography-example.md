Markdown defines a few levels of headings. A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space necessary to render the heading. For example:

# This is a top level heading

`# This is a top level heading`

Use header elements when you want to make the hierarchical structure of a document explicit. This is needed as header elements themselves only contain the text of the header, and do not imply any structural division of documents into sections. Header elements have the same content model as paragraphs, that is text and character level markup, such as character emphasis, inline images, form fields and math

## Second level heading

`## Second level heading`

[Lorem ipsum](http://generator.lorem-ipsum.info/) is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography, layout, and printing in place of English to emphasise design elements over content. It's also called placeholder (or filler) text

### h3, h4, h5 and h6 have the same style

`### h3, h4, h5 and h6 have the same style`

Less is more and simplicity is the key.
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.
Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.
Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.
Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~
